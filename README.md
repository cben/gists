Gists
=====

Python CLI interface for managing gists

Configure
---------

Copy the gists.rc file to ~/.gists.rc and edit your github username and password.
You can live without this config file using always the '-u (--user)' argument every
time you perform an action and '-s (--secret)' argument every time you perform an 
action that needs authentication.


How it works
